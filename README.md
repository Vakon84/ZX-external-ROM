# ZX Spectrum external ROM

The interface allows you to connect an external ROM. The interface uses a 64K x 8-bit memory organization system, e.g. EEPROM W27C (E) 512 - 4 banks 16KB each, switched with DIP switch, which gives us the opportunity to run 4 different ROMs. 
After uploading the diagnostic ROMs, it can be used as a simple diagnostic interface for repairs.

The interface will work properly with computers:

* ZX Spectrum 48
* ZX Spectrum 128
* ZX Spectrum +2
* Timex 2048

The interface does not work with ZX Spectrum 128 + 2A / B and +3 computers
